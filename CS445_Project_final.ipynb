This was the starting learning rate as they both had the same decreasing learning rate as a higher step rate was reached. The second network(N2) had a much smaller time input with only 8000 steps but a larger batch size of 12 and a smaller starting learning rate of .003. \n",

        "The results are given as percentages of Average Precision and Average Recall. Average precision is how often a guess by the network is correct and average recall is how many boats the networks correctly guessed compared to how many there actually were. They are then averaged based on the IoU(intersection over union) which is how much the networks guess overlaps the actual correct answer. If the IoU is .5 or above it is considered a correct guess. IoU=.5:.95 is an average of the precision of correct answers over the interval .5 to .95. The MaxDets is how many guesses the network was allowed to make. We will mostly be paying attention to the IoU values of .5 and .75 with maxDets at 100 and Area being all.\n",

The fact that N2 beat N1 at general correct guesses was surprising as N1 had a much longer training time. We can take the inputs of the smaller learning rate and higher batch size and assume that both of these lead to a quicker success for generally finding images. We can also take this result to assume that a larger step rate is most important for creating a higher accuracy of guesses. \n",
